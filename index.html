        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Kumoru.io documentation. Kumoru is a service for making application management and deployment as simple as possible on public clouds.
The documenation on this site is intended to describe Kumoru concepts and how to consume the Kumoru service through the CLI.</p>

<p>We do not currently have language bindings for the APIs. Please let us know if you would like to see bindings for your favorite language. The commands shown are done so with the official <a href="https://github.com/kumoru/kumoru-cli">kumoru cli</a>.</p>

<h2 id="customer-fit">Customer Fit</h2>

<h3 id="stateless-applications">Stateless Applications</h3>

<p>Kumoru was designed to run and scale applications with ease. As part of this design there is no shared state between containers. This means that any data local to a container is lost if that contianer stops for any reason, whether it&rsquo;s failure or a scaling down event.</p>

<p>A good guide for applications that will run great in kumoru is the <a href="http://12factor.net/">12 factor app</a>.</p>

<p>It is intended for users to store state in another location, such as a remote database, cache or queue.</p>

<h3 id="soa-and-microservice">SOA and Microservice</h3>

<p>Kumoru allows users to run multiple applications on the same set of resources. Ideally users should plan their architecture around either a Service Oriented Architexture or a Microservices model. Both are accetable inside Kumoru.</p>

<p>All publicly exposed applications are load balanced automatically. Connecting applications can be done by referncing their addresses.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-first">Cloud First</h3>

<p>Currently Kumoru only runs applications on AWS however additional public clouds will be allowed in the future. This means that applications can take full advantage of what AWS has to offer (RDS, S3, DynamoDB, etc).</p>

          <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h2>

<p>The goal of this quickstart is to create, deploy, update, and delete an appliction using the Kumoru Command Line Interface.  This is intended to be a short dive into the CLI, but if you would like more information we have anchored the quickstart steps to more detailed sections in the documentation.  </p>

<p>Next we will create our first application, <code class="prettyprint">sample-app</code>, using a small image our team created ahead of time.</p>

<p>Here is some information on the options we passed:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">-p</code> tells Kumoru that we want to expose port <code class="prettyprint">80</code> on the loadbalancer and connect that to port <code class="prettyprint">8080</code> which is exposed in the container</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">-r</code> tells Kumoru that we want to use the docker image tag <code class="prettyprint">green</code> and weight the traffic at 100%</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">-e</code> tells Kumoru that we want the environment variable <code class="prettyprint">VERSION</code> available to our containers</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">-t</code> tells Kumoru that we want to tag the application with <code class="prettyprint">getting-started</code> for easier filtering in the clients</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">0269fc49-db71-400c-bfb5-cd5f47cc782c</code> is the pool UUID that we want the application deployed into</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">quay.io/kumoru/sample-app</code> is the docker image URL (without the image tag)</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">sample-app</code> is the name of the application</li>
</ul>

<p>If you get a <code class="prettyprint">403 forbidden access to pool â€¦</code>, make sure they UUID you used it correct.</p>

<h2 id="deploy-the-sample-application">Deploy the sample application</h2>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>kumoru applications deploy 4a12ee96-809b-4295-8e12-e082bda8004d

</code></pre>

<p>You can start your first deployment using the UUID of the application we just created. This will take a few moments the first time since Kumoru must </p>

<ol>
<li>Download the docker image</li>
<li>Start the containers</li>
<li>Create an ELB and wait for the ELB DNS record to resolve prior to considering the application as <code class="prettyprint">running</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This is the longest process when using Kumoru. Future deployments are considerably faster since Kumoru only needs to download docker image differentials.</p>

<p>In the last step we changed the rules for the application but hadn&rsquo;t yet deployed the changes. We must initiate a new deployment of the applciation for the changes to take effect.</p>

<p>All HTTP requests to Kumoru.io services must be cryptographically signed. The Kumoru APIs follow the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-05">Internet Draft</a> which describes message signing. This is very similar to how <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html">AWS</a> signs their requests.</p>

<aside class="warning">cURL isn&rsquo;t available to interact with the APIs due to the requirement that all requests be signed.</aside>

<p>As of December 2015: 
- You can have as many tokens as you like and tokens do not expire.
- Both UUIDs are generated by the authorization API.</p>

<p>In the future:</p>

<p>Applications are the primary focus of Kumoru. We expect users to interact with Kumoru primarily by creating applications and deploying them.</p>

<p>When an application is created, it is not deployed by default. You&rsquo;ll need to create an initial <a href="#deployments">deployment</a> to have a running application.</p>

<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>

<p>To see any logs generated by your application you must configure it to send them to a remote service. This can be done by using a logging library in your code or if your container image has an opterating system configuring a loggin service (i.e.syslog) to forward logs to a remote service.</p>

          <h1 id="deployments">Deployments</h1>

<p>Deployments represent a running rule for an application. There will be a deployment for every rule specified on an application.</p>

<p>Deployments are immutable and capture the application details at the time of their creation. This means that an application can be rolled back via the details of that deployment.</p>

<p>When an application is deployed, Kumoru will attempt to figure out if any changes have been made (i.e. a new docker image hash, change environment variables, etc). If no changes are present, no actions are taken.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-deployment">Create a deployment</h2>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>kumoru applications deploy APPLICATION_UUID
â€¦
</code></pre>

<p>Deploying a new or changed application always following the same process</p>

<ol>
<li>Commit code and create a new docker image.</li>
<li>Update the application rules if required (i.e. if a new docker tag is needed)</li>
<li>Create a deployment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally docker image building should be automated. If this is the case then most of the time the only step needed to get the new software running is to create the deployment.</p>

          <h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<h3 id="why-can-39-t-stateful-applications-deployed-in-kumoru-io">Why can&rsquo;t stateful applications deployed in Kumoru.io?</h3>

<p>Technically, they can. However there is no gaurantee of state for a given container or between containers.
This means that if you were to deploy a mysql image, there would be two running containers of mysql with no
shared data between them. If there is a failure, a new container will be scheduled and will not have any data from the failed container.</p>

<p>These restrictions are forced because we view infrastructure as needing separate scaling mechanisms. Databases require a very different approach to scaling than an API service and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>We expect users to leverage remote resources for state. This means you can consume a cloud service (i.e. RDS) or run your own service (i.e. mysql on EC2). Both can be accessed by your service via Environment Variables.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-dogfood-your-service">Do you dogfood your service?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you asked. The answer is yes. We are our first customer!</p>

<p>The APIs you interact with when consuming kumoru.io are all hosted via Kumoru.io. This makes bootstraping our APIs interesting but that&rsquo;s a story for another time.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-explain-deployments-and-applications-better">Can you explain deployments and applications better?</h3>

<p>Applications are simply the instructions for deployments. When an application is created, we&rsquo;ve really just saved the rules for future deployments which is why a deployment is required to get the application running.</p>

<p>Deployments on the otherhand represent the running point in time of an application. As such, deployments are immutable. This has the following side effects:</p>

<ol>
<li>Details about a application at a specific point in time are stored forever as a deployment.</li>
<li>Deployments can be used to rollback an application to the state when they were created.</li>
<li>There will be a deployment for each <code class="prettyprint">rule</code> (i.e. image tag) that is configured on an application.</li>
</ol>

<p>The vast majority of actions an user will take on kumoru is deploying applications. After the initial deployment, deploying updates is a very quick process (depending on docker image size).</p>

          <h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>

<p>Our intent is to make using the Kumoru service as simple as possible.  We try to use generic technology terms that one would already be familiar with, but we can&rsquo;t meet everyone&rsquo;s expectations or experience.  Using the following definitions will help you understand how to navigate the Kumoru experience.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Account</em>: data representing an user</li>
<li><em>Application</em>: information Kumoru will use to create a deployment.</li>
<li><em>Deployment</em>: an immutable instantiation of an application.</li>
<li><em>Region</em>: clustered resources in a cloud provider managed by Kumoru</li>
</ul>
