# Regions

**Definition:** Regions are clustered resources in a cloud provider managed by the Kumoru services.

All applications assigned to a given region will run with a minimum of 2 containers inside of that region.

Regions are designed to be abstract and we purposly present minimal information about them.

- The amount of resources (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network) are static for all regions in the Alpha phase.
    - CPU: 3 x 1 vCPU
    - RAM: 3 x 3.75GiB
    - Disk: 3 x 40GB (General Purpose 2)

- There is no guarantee that all containers for a given application will run on different nodes. There is a guarantee of containers being re-scheduled elsewhere if a member goes offline for any reason.

## Region Security

 - Access to region members is completely locked down from the outside except for SSH access.
 - SSH keys are the only form of SSH access (passwords are not set)
 - Members run a recent version of the CoreOS operating system configured to auto-update. Members are configured to be part of the 'stable' channel.
 - Due to the need for intra-cluster communication, port access is not restricted between region members.
