# Getting Started

## Quickstart

<aside class="warning">Please note that during our Alpha phase, user accounts must be manually enabled by our team</aside>

1. Install the CLI
    - Download the latest release: <https://github.com/kumoru/kumoru-cli/releases>
1. Create an Account
    - <code>kumoru accounts create -f $firstName -l $lastName -p $yourPassword $emailAddress</code>
1. Request Kumoru account activation at <support@kumoru.io>
1. Create a Token
    - <code> kumoru tokens create </code>
1. Choose Pool to Deploy Application into, notate UUID
    - <code> kumoru pools list </code>
1. Create an Application, notate UUID
    - <code>kumoru applications create -p 80:8080 -r green=100 -e VERSION=v1 -t $tagName $poolUUID quay.io/kumoru/sample-app $yourAppName</code>
1. Deploy an Application
    - <code> kumoru applications deploy $yourAppUUID</code>

## Sample Application

Let's deploy a sample application which will show the deployment workflow, traffic rules, port access, tagging and environment variables.

The following steps assume you have an active user account and a valid token.

##Decide which pool to deploy to:

```shell
kumoru pools list

Location   Uuid                                  Status
us-east-1  0269fc49-db71-400c-bfb5-cd5f47cc782c  running
```

Note the UUID of your pool since you'll need it for the next command.

##Create the sample application

```shell
kumoru applications create \
-p 80:8080 \
-r green=100 \
-e VERSION=v1 \
-t getting-started \
0269fc49-db71-400c-bfb5-cd5f47cc782c quay.io/kumoru/sample-app sample-app

```

Next we'll create our first application, `sample-app`, using a small image our team created ahead of time.

Here is some information on the options we passed:

* `-p` tells Kumoru that we want to expose port `80` on the loadbalancer and connect that to port `8080` which is exposed in the container
* `-r` tells Kumoru that we want to use the docker image tag `green` and weight the traffic at 100%
* `-e` tells Kumoru that we want the environment variable `VERSION` available to our containers
* `-t` tells Kumoru that we want to tag the application with `getting-started` for easier filtering in the clients
* `0269fc49-db71-400c-bfb5-cd5f47cc782c` is the pool UUID that we want the application deployed into
* `quay.io/kumoru/sample-app` is the docker image URL (without the image tag)
* `sample-app` is the name of the application

If you get a `403 forbidden access to pool â€¦`, make sure they UUID you used it correct.

##Deploy the sample application

```shell
kumoru applications deploy 4a12ee96-809b-4295-8e12-e082bda8004d
Deploying application 4a12ee96-809b-4295-8e12-e082bda8004d
```

You can start your first deployment using the UUID of the application we just created. This will take a few moments the first time since Kumoru must 

1. Download the docker image
1. Start the containers
1. Create an ELB and wait for the ELB DNS record to resolve prior to considering the application as `running`

This is the longest process when using Kumoru. Future deployments are considerably faster since Kumoru only needs to download docker image differentials.

##Access the sample application

```shell
kumoru applications show 4a12ee96-809b-4295-8e12-e082bda8004d

We can access the application by leveraging the `address` associated with it. Use `kumoru application show` to see all details about a given application.

You may open the address in a browser(`df30014009fe4e1f9f75d7b27d8574d1-458773757.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com` in my case) or curl it from the command line to see the content.

##Update the sample application

```shell
kumoru applications patch \
-r blue=100 \
-e VERSION=v2 \
4a12ee96-809b-4295-8e12-e082bda8004d

```

Change the docker image tag to `blue` and change the ENV VERSION to `v2` to show that we do indeed get an updated version of our application without downtime.

##Deploy the changes

```shell
kumoru applications deploy 4a12ee96-809b-4295-8e12-e082bda8004d
Deploying application 4a12ee96-809b-4295-8e12-e082bda8004d
```

In the last step we changed the rules for the application but hadn't yet deployed the changes. We must initiate a new deployment of the applciation for the changes to take effect.

Refresh the page in the browser or curl the address again to see the new content. You may need to force refresh your browser to clean the cache.

Note that this process takes considerably less time than the initial deployment.

##Delete the sample application

```shell
kumoru applications delete 4a12ee96-809b-4295-8e12-e082bda8004d
Application 4a12ee96-809b-4295-8e12-e082bda8004d accepted for archival
```

You may delete the application when ready. Deleting applications removes any resources associated with it(ELB, containers, etc) but the application data will persist in the datastore in an `archived` state.
